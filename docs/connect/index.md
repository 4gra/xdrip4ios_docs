# Connect a Data Source

## Master or Follower?

In order to be able to see Blood Glucose data in xDrip4iOS, you need to connect it to a data source.

There are two types of data sources that you can use:

In **Master** mode, your iPhone will connect directly to a bluetooth-enabled CGM system (sensor/transmitter) in order to receive real-time data.

In **Follower** mode, your iPhone will connect to a Nightscout site over the internet  and pull real-time data. 

Put simply, a **Master** is usually the actual diabetic person/patient who is wearing the sensor and a **Follower** is usually a parent/caregiver that wants to be able to track (follow) the first person's CGM values.

## Blood Glucose Unit

Once we've decided where we want to use xDrip4iOS as a **Master** or a **Follower** device, we need to click on the Settings tab and chose the mode we want. To change the mode, just click on the option until it shows what you want.

Then make sure that your Blood Glucose unit is correctly set. If you are used to seeing your BG values with decimal places such as 4.7, 6.3 or 10.4 then you are using **mmol/l**.

If you usually see your BG values as bigger numbers such as 76, 127 or 215 then you are using **mg/dl**.

Once you've set your device mode and BG unit, you're ready to connect a data source.
