# Install from Testflight

Testflight is Apple's platform that allows developers to distribute test versions (often known as Beta versions) of their apps. It is generally much easier for developers to publish for testing compared to releasing them in the main App Store. There are less restrictions and it is also easier for developers to release several versions in quick succession in order to work out bugs and issues.

There are two main ways to get xDrip4iOS on your iPhone:

- Install from Testflight
- Build and install from source code.

The first option is easy for everybody. 

The second option is more complex and needs a Mac and some knowledge/experience, but it allows you to modify the code and install custom versions as required.

Anybody who is using xDrip4iOS for looping should always build from source.
