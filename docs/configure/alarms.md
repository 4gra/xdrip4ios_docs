# Setting Alarms

xDrip4iOS, the same as all other CGM apps, is able to alert you to certain events but sounding an alarm on your iPhone.

Alarms can be configured to happen for different reasons, such as:

- your blood glucose is getting too low
- your blood glucose is dropping very quickly
- your blood glucose is getting high
- you need to put in your initial calibration
- you have stopped getting readings from your sensor

We can also use alarms to function as **reminders** to remind us to:

- calibrate our sensor every *x* days
- stop and buy bread on the way home from work
- not really, but we're glad you're reading everything

There are **two steps** to configure an alarm in xDrip4iOS.

1. We define the **Alarm Types**. These are different types of alarms that we can use to alert us to different types of events.
<br /><br />
2. We define the **Alarms** themselves. These trigger different types of alarm based upon certain events that happen or conditions that we decide.


!!!info "Before we continue..."
    Let's just quickly get the concept clear. Take a deep breath and repeat after me...

       - An **Alarm Type** can be used for many different **Alarms**.<br /><br />
       - Any **Alarm** can only use one **Alarm Type** at a time.

## Alarm Types

Here we will define the different types of alarm that we will hear. 

If you go into Alarm Types, you will see that we there is a default Alarm Type set. We called it "Default"... because we're original and clever. You can modify this, or you can create your own Alarm Type.

If you want to add a new/custom Alarm Type, click the + button and configure it.

We can set the following parameters for an Alarm Type:

| Option &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Description &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
|:-------------- |:------------- |
| **Enabled**      | If enabled, any alarm assigned with this alarm type will alert us. If not enabled, the assigned alarm will not trigger  |
| **Name**      | Enter a name here such as "Loud", "Urgent" or "Quiet"  |
| **Vibrate**      | If enabled, the alarm will vibrate the phone  | 
| **Sound**      | Choose the sound that you want to play when the alarm is triggered  |
| **Override Mute**     | If enabled, the alarm will sound even if we have the phone in "Silent Mode"  |
| **Snooze Via Notification**      | If enabled, any notification will give us the option to "snooze" the alarm during *x* minutes  |
| **Default Snooze Time**      | Once we snooze an alarm, how many minutes should it wait before alarming again?  |

Once you've finished editing your Alarm Type, make sure you hit **Done** in the top-right corner. If you don't, you'll lose your changes.
