xDrip4iOS can be used with several other types of popular smartwatches although the way of using them to see your data with change depending on the type of smartwatch used.

**Instructions pending**
___
## Garmin

- Forerunner or Fenix watches (Glucose Values, graphs)
- Garmin Edge cycle computers (Glucose Values)
- Internet connection and Nightscout needed

Please note that xDrip4iOS **does not** have an internal http server so you **will** need to pull data from Nightscout.

Once you have Nightscout running correctly, you will need to download **Garmin IQ** and **Garmin Connect** on your iPhone. Garmin IQ is used to download and configure the data field and Garmin Connect is used to send the data to your watch/Edge while you exercise.

You will then need to configure one of your sports profiles (Ebike, mountain bike, etc) to use the data field you configured in the previous step.
